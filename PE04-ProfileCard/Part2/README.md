This React Native application 'Styling' shows six profile cards. A user's image, name, occupation, and description are displayed on each card. The cards are both expandable and collapsable but only one card can be expanded at a time.
# Input:
The input is hardcoded information which includes the user image, name, the occupation and the user description. The same information is used in all six cards.

# Process:
The wntire screen is wrapped by an initial View, which also has another View for arranging the six profile cards. Every card uses Image for the profile photo and Text for the name, description, and occupation. A StyleSheet is used to apply stylistic elements like height, width, scale and others.

# Output:
The output is a mobile screen with six blue profile cards. The user information is shown in the centre of each card. When a card is pressed, it expands and collapses other expanded cards if any; making sure that only one card is expanded at a time.
