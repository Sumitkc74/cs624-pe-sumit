This is a simple React Native application called 'Styling' that displays a userâ€™s profile image, name, designation and their description.

# Input:
The input in the application is the hardcoded information: the user image, name, the designation and the user description.

# Process:
A View is used to center the layout for the profile card, an Image is used to show the profile picture, Text is used for the name, designation and description, and a StyleSheet is used to apply styles such as background colour, spacing, and circular borders.

# Output:
The output is a mobile screen with a blue container for the profile card and the input information (image, name, designation and description) at the center of the card (container).
