This is a native react application that enables users to explore MSCS course categories, such as core, depth, and capstone courses. Users can also enter their preferred course.

# Input
The user can enter their favorite course in the text field. The app also displays MSCS courses, categorized into core requirements, depth of study, and capstone courses.

# Process
The app is developed using React Native components like ScrollView, View, Text, TextInput, and StyleSheet. ScrollView allows the content to be scrollable, and View acts as a container. TextInput allows user input, and Text components show course details. For styling, StyleSheet is used to style the components, ensuring a tidy layout. To improve maintainability, course sections are dynamically rendered by the CourseList component.

# Output
The output consists of a scrollable interface that includes an icon image, an input field for users to type in their favourite course, and a list of courses in MSCS degree.
