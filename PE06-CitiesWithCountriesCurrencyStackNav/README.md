This is a simple React Native application called 'CitiesWithCountriesCurrencyStackNav' that enables users to add and view lists of cities and countries, or countries and currencies as well as add locations or local currencies to each entered city or country respectively.

# Input:
Users can enter data in the AddCity and AddCountry tabs. In the AddCity tab, users enter the name of a city with the associated country and in the AddCountry tab, users enter the name of a country and its currency. Form fields are used to collect these inputs. Users can also click on each entered city or country and enter additional information about location or currency.

# Process:
The application verifies that no fields are left blank when clicking on submit button. It then creates an object using the entered data and uses the uuid library to generate a unique ID. The input city or country information is added as the new entry and displayed in respective cities or countries tab. Nested entries, such as locations for cities or local currencies for countries, can be viewed by clicking on an item in either list to bring up a detail screen. These changes appear after returning to the page with the listed items.

# Output:
The output is displayed in the Cities and Countries tabs. The Cities tab displays a scrollable list of cities with their countries, and the Countries tab shows a similar list of countries with their currencies. If there is no data in a tab, a message is shown indicating no data is available in that tab. Each entered city or country is clickable and additional information like location or currency can be viewed.
