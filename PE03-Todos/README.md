This is a react native app that records a list of to do activities.

# Input

The app has a user input text box where the user can enter the to-do task. The user can also mark the entered task as done or delete them. 

# Process
The app manages the to-do tasks by saving them in a list after they are added.  A task's status can be changed by marking as done, or completely removing it from the list by deleting. The tasks can also be filtered by status: all tasks, active tasks or completed tasks. Only the tasks that fit the chosen filter are displayed dynamically in the app.

# Ouptut
The app displays a list of to-do tasks entered by the user with an option to either mark them as done or remove them. To make managing their to-do task list easier, the user can switch between the filters to display all tasks, the active tasks, or the completed tasks.
