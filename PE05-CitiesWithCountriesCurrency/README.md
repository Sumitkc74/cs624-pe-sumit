This is a simple React Native application called 'CitiesWithCountriesCurrency' that enables users to add and view lists of cities and countries, or countries and currencies.

# Input:
Users can enter data in the AddCity and AddCountry tabs. In the AddCity tab, users enter the name of a city with the associated country and in the AddCountry tab, users enter the name of a country and its currency. Form fields are used to collect these inputs.

# Process:
The application verifies that no fields are left blank when clicking on submit button. It then creates an object using the entered data and uses the uuid library to generate a unique ID. The input city or country information is added as the new entry and displayed in respective cities or countries tab.

# Output:
The ouptut is displayed in the Cities and Countries tabs. The Cities tab displays a scrollable list of cities with their countries, and the Countries tab shows a similar list of countries with their currencies. If there is no data in a tab, a message is shown indicating no data is available in that tab.
